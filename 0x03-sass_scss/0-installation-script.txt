Steps I Followed to Install Sass on Windows
===========================================

1. I installed Node.js
   - I went to https://nodejs.org
   - I downloaded and installed the LTS version (recommended).
   - After installation, I confirmed it worked by running in Command Prompt or Git Bash:
        node -v
        npm -v
     (Both showed version numbers.)

2. I installed Sass Globally
   - I ran this command in Git Bash or Command Prompt:
        npm install -g sass

3. I verified Sass Installation
   - I checked the version:
        sass --version
     (It displayed a version number.)

4. I created a Sass File
   - Inside my project folder, I created a file named:
        style.scss
   - Example content I added:
        $primary: #0e6cff;

        body {
          background: $primary;
          color: white;
        }

5. I compiled Sass to CSS
   - I ran:
        sass style.scss style.css
   - This created style.css in the same folder.

6. I used Watch Mode (auto-compile on save)
   - I ran:
        sass --watch style.scss:style.css
   - Every time I saved style.scss, style.css updated automatically.

7. I linked CSS in HTML
   - I added this line inside my HTML <head>:
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

Done 
I had successfully used Sass in my Windows projects.

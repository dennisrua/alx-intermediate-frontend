# HTML Semantic Structure Practice

## What This Project is About
This project demonstrates the creation of a simple HTML file (`0-index.html`) to practice using semantic elements.

The file begins with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration and includes the basic structure with `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.  

Inside the body:
- A **header** section contains a **nav** element with three links.  
- A **main** section includes an **article**, which has a **h1** title and a **section** for the content.  
- A **footer** is added at the bottom with copyright information.  

The goal of this exercise is to practice writing clean, semantic HTML code that is organized and meaningful.
